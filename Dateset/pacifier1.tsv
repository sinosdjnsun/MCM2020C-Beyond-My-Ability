The heartbeat/womb sounds helped our first daughter to sleep and she still sleeps with her heartbeat bear (she's almost 3) and this is baby number 2's. I do wish the volume could be turned down more. The bear is also a darker chocolate brown than I anticipated based off the items picture which was disappointing for me.  Edit - Once the womb noise times out, restarting it is a hassle. Just turning the switch to off and then back on does not work. It requires turning the switch to off multiple times to get it restart the womb noise. Sometimes it takes two times. Sometimes it takes seven. It's not reliable and I wish I would have purchased a different heartbeat bear."	8/31/2015

"these bags make it obvious why the lansinoh bags are so popular.<br /><br />cons:<br />- the medela bags are nearly impossible to get zip closed, and i can never seem to do it without getting milk on the top and air inside the bag.<br /><br />- they are also horrible for measurement. what looks like 5oz on the bag is actually around 4oz if you measure with a medela bottle. i'm not sure how to get the bag to stand up with milk in it and hit the 5oz mark correctly.<br /><br />- the idea of pumping directly into a bag is fantastic. but i exclusively pump and routinely get 4-5oz from one side, which makes pumping precarious because these bags are nearly full with that amount.<br /><br />- the medela bags do not freeze flat. they are thicker at one end, which makes these bags a space hog in my freezer.<br /><br />i'm only using these medela bags until my new box of lansinoh bags arrives in a couple of days."	8/30/2015
